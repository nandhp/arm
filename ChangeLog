	- Debugging Information Format now supports compressed debugging
	  information ("ZBG", default), or the old uncompressed "DBG" format.
	- Debugging Information now includes line numbers, not currently
	  used in debugger.
	- Added --no-zlib (Refuse to read or write "ZBG" DIF) and
	  --dump-debuginfo (Decompress/Dump DIF) options.
	- Fixed some bugs with use of shorthand LR=R14 and implemented
	  shorthands SP=R13, IP=R12, FP=R11, SL=R10.
	- Added support for LDM/STM.
	- The assembler now allows labels that are not designated with a :,
	  all instructions must now be indented.
	- Fixed LDR/PC bug

20050811
	- ARM Debugger fixed, improved disassembler to take advantage of
	  debugging information
	- Removed needless mucking about with |s, %labels and $lastlabel.

20050802
	- Fixed some memory bugs
	- ARM Simulator Update works on Windows systems without Win32::API

20050801
	- Created a new, improved website and wrote ARM Simulator Update,
	  an automatic-update utility written in Perl/Tk.
	- Removed obsolete function translate().
	- Properly implement conditions HI (1000) and LS (1001).
	- Rewrite most of the code to seperate into (1) compilation,
	  (2) disassembly and (3) execution.
	- Broke ARM Debugger, because the assembled machine code has
	  no link to the original .s files. A debugging information
	  format will be devised for the next release.
	- LDR and STR support should be roughly equal to the last version,
	  despite parsing support for pre- and post- indexing. It is
	  suggested (although not required) that you use the new ADR
	  instruction instead of LDR=.
	- All parsing should be roughly compliant.
	- Added -o, -a, -D and -x options to allow access to new features.
	  Read the documentation.
	- Added Licensing information. Made release notes vaugely valid HTML.
	  Mildly improved throw() and isreg(). Fixed byte-ordering.

20050602
	- arm.pl now uses 4 byte instructions and to store
	  instructions in memory. There may be bugs.
	- Instructions are now referred to by file name and line number.
	- Fixed and enhanced --version.
	- Various bugs have been fixed as per your comments, including an
	  annoyance with translate().
	- Implemented the new ARM Debugger. Read perldoc arm.pl.
	- Implemented OUTB, output byte(s).

20050523
	- Added support for strings in order to get strcmp.s to run
	- Fixed various FOP weirdness
	- Implemented FOPs: LSL, LSR, ASR, ROR. ROX still unimplemented.
	  Added FOP CO Support
	- Implemented AND, ORR and SBC (Subtract with Carry)
	- SUB, CMP, ADD, LDR and STR are now out of beta
	- Made feeble attempt to get EOL comments working
	- Wrote primes.s, divide.s, isprime.s, countchar.s, fibonacci.s,
	  strcmp.s

20050512
	- Added support for -d flag: Run with perl(1) debugger
	- Added EOR
	- Fixed bug where Label1: DCD #0 <CR> DCD #1, Label1 would point to 1
	  and not 0
	- Fixed label case-sensitivity issue
	- Fixed bug in parser which caused hex numbers with & to work only
	  in DCx.
	- Fixed (?) bug so that =Label would work outside of LDR and STR.
	- Numberize more numbers in more places
	
20050506
	- Initial release
